# Advanced Data Types

When learning about manipulating data, we learned about the "simple" data types.

In this lesson, we'll be discussing the more complex type data type: **Objects**.

You may have noticed that all the data types we've seen so far are individual items:

```js
"a string", 10, true;
```

What do we do if we have multiple values though?

---

# Arrays

```js
let arrayExample = [
  1,
  "string",
  true,
  function () {
    console.log("yes, you can have a list of functions");
  },
  [
    "oh no",
    "we can have arrays in arrays?",
    ["in arrays in arrays in arrays?", "yes ðŸ˜­"],
  ],
];
```

- Arrays are a special kind of **Object**
- We use it to store a list of values together
- **The list keeps its ordering**
- This list can be reordered however you'd like
- Duplicates are allowed (some more advanced JavaScript tools automatically take duplicates out)

---

# Array Syntax

You can make an array using `[ ]`, known as square brackets.

```js
let emptyArray = [];

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
```

---

# Array Indexes

- Arrays, like Strings, are also indexed and begin at 0
- We use indexes to refer to individual values stored within the array
  - e.g. `arrayExample[0]` gets the first item of arrayExample
  - This method of accessing items is referred to as "square bracket notation"

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
fruits[1];
```

Which value does this code access?

---

# Length

Because an array is a kind of Object (more on these later), they have **properties**.

- These are values held within Objects to help you manipulate them.
- All arrays come with a property called `length`.

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
fruits.length; // => 3
```

How can we use this information to help us get the last value of an array without knowing its exact index?

---

# Literacy Practice: Dynamically Accessing the Last Index

We will often build programs using data we do not personally manage or create.
This means we usually will _not_ know the details of what the values are, how many there are, etc.

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
fruits[fruits.length - 1];
```

- How does this work? What is happening on the last line?
- What happens if we try to access index `99`?

---

# Adding Values to an Array

Before, we used _square bracket notation_ to "read" values from the array.

Now, we are using it with the assignment operator `=` to add or "write" values to the array.

`fruits[0] = 'apricot'` will set the `0`th item of the array to the string `'apricot'`

How is this similar to variables?

---

# Array Methods

Before, we covered the property length, which returns a `Number` every time.

Arrays also have properties called **methods** that are functions held within them.

These functions allow you to manipulate the array in a wide variety of ways.

For now let's look at some of the most common array methods:

- `push`/`shift`
- `pop`/`unshift`
- `reverse`
- `slice`
- `join`
- `split`

---

# Adding Values to the Right Side

- `.push` adds a value to the end of an array

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
fruits.push("pineapple");
fruits; //=> ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "pineapple"]
```

- `.push` can also add several values at once

```js
fruits.push("nectarine", "strawberry");
fruits; //=> ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "pineapple", "nectarine", "strawberry"]
```

> `.push` returns the new length of the array

---

# Removing Values from the Right Side

To remove a value from the end of an array you can use the `.pop` method

- `.pop` always removes the last item in the array
- `.pop` takes no arguments
- `.pop` can only ever remove one item at a time, and it's **always** the last item in the array
- `.pop` returns the item that was removed. THis means you can use it for variable assignments!

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "tangerine"];
let lastFruit = fruits.pop();
fruits; // => ["apple", "banana"]
lastFruit; // => "tangerine"
```

---

# Slicing and Dicing

You can `slice` an array to cut it into smaller arrays, a lot like how you can slice a string to get a smaller string.

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"];

// this means "slice from item 1 to item 3"
fruits.slice(1, 3); //=> [ 'banana', 'cherry' ]

// this means "slice from item 2 to the end"
fruits.slice(2); //=> [ 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry' ]
```

If you need an item from a middle index you can use `.slice` to access it.

[MDN: slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)

---

# Array Indexing

Array indexing works in the same way as string indexing.

Think of the indexes as pointing at the _spaces between_ items, as in this diagram:

```js
0   1   2   3   4
| B | L | U | E |
['B','L','U','E']
```

---

# Arrays Vs. Strings

You might remember learning that strings are technically lists of characters.

If you have an array of strings, you can combine them all to make one big string:

```js
let fullName = ["Bob", "Saget"];
fullName.join();   // 'Bob,Saget'
fruits.join(" ");  // 'Bob Saget'
fruits.toString(); // 'Bob,Saget'
```

---

# Arrays Vs. Strings Cont.

Just like we can convert arrays to strings, the opposite is true.

You can also turn a string into an array with the string method called `.split`.

Split does not know which character in the string to do the actual _splitting_ at, so it needs an argument.

```javascript
"Bob Saget".split("");  //=> [ 'B', 'o', 'b', ' ', 'S', 'a', 'g', 'e', 't' ]
"Bob Saget".split(" "); //=> [ 'Bob', 'Saget' ]
"Bob Saget".split("o"); //=> [ 'B', 'b Saget' ]
```

> Note: Arrays and String have their own separate sets of methods. Some might have the same names.

# Arrays In Depth

Arrays are very useful data structures.

* They can contain any type of data
* They're ordered
* They have many inherent methods for manipulating the data they contain.

Let's take a closer look at a few of these iteration methods!

---

# Looping Through an Array with for-of

Recently, JavaScript added `for..of`, which hides the messy details of incrementing an index counter and accessing each array item.

```js
for (let fruit of fruits) {
  console.log("I like " + fruit + "!")
}
```

|phrase|meaning|
|---|---|
| `for`                    | in a loop, |
| `of fruits`              | take each thing inside `fruits` |
| `let fruit`              | name it `fruit` |
| `{` ... `}`              | and send it to this block of code |

---

# Iteration Methods

Every JavaScript array has a few [very handy methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Iteration_methods)
that let you *apply a function* to its contents.

| method | description | returns |
|---|---|---|
| [`forEach`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach)  | do something to each item | `undefined`|
| [`find`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)  | find the first item that matches | one matching item (or `undefined` if no match) |
| [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) | accept or reject each item | a new collection, possibly smaller |
| [`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)  | change each item into a new item | a new collection of the same size |
| [`reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)  | scan the entire collection and "reduce" it to... | ...a single result, e.g. a total |

* We call this group of methods "[iteration methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Iteration_methods)"
* There are about a dozen built-in iteration methods, plus lots more added by libraries like [lodash](https://lodash.com/).

---

# forEach

`forEach` works a lot like `for..of`, but using a callback function

Given this array of names...

```javascript
let names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Charlie']
```
This code...

```js
function printUpper(name) {
  console.log(name.toUpperCase())
};

names.forEach(printUpper)
```

prints:

```text
ALICE
BOB
CAROL
CHARLIE
DAVID
```

---

# Find

To find the first item that matches the condition...

```javascript
let names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Charlie'];

let beginsWithC = function(word) {
  return word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() === 'C';
};

let cName = names.find(beginsWithC); //=> 'Carol'
```

Note that:

* the `beginsWithC` function returns `true` or `false`
* the `.find` method returns an item (from the array)
  * that causes `beginsWithC` to return `true`

---

# Find Inline

For conciseness, people often define the filter function *inline*, like this:

```javascript
let cName = names.find(function (word) {
    return word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() === 'C'
  }
);
```

Is this more or less clear than the previous slide?

---

# Filter

the `.filter` iteration method returns *all* matching values, in a *new array*

```javascript
let names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Carol'];

let beginsWithC = function(word) {
  return word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() === 'C';
};

let cNames = names.filter(beginsWithC); //=> [ 'Charlie', 'Carol' ]
```

---

# Map

The `.map` iteration method returns a *new array* whose elements correspond to the elements of the original array.

```javascript
let names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Carol'];
let upper = function(word) {
  return word.toUpperCase();
}
let bigNames = names.map(upper) //=> [ 'ALICE', 'BOB', 'CHARLIE', 'CAROL']
```

It's called "map" because in a mathematical sense, it defines a *mapping* from one collection to another.

| from | to |
|---|---|
| 'Alice'| 'ALICE' | 
| 'Bob'| 'BOB' |
| 'Charlie' | 'CHARLIE' |
| 'Carol' | 'CAROL' |

---

# Method Chaining

* **method chaining** is the practice of taking the **result** of one method, and immediately calling a method on that result **without assigning it to a variable**, again and again until you get a final result.
* Method chaining can be very elegant, but it can also be very dense, making the code harder to understand, test, and debug.
* "Unspooling" a method chain into intermediate variables can make the code easier to follow, but it can also make it much more verbose and obscure the algorithm.
* For example; we could take the results of a `filter` method, and *chain* a `map` method off it to return a modified subset of an array.

---

# Reduce

The `reduce` method keeps track of a *running total* (aka *accumulator* or *memo*); whatever value the function returns is used as the accumulator for the next pass.

Here's some code that counts the total number of letters across all words in an array:

```javascript
let numbers = [17, 3, 2, 20];

const reducer = function(accumulator, nextNum) {
  return accumulator +nextNum;
};

let totalCount = numbers.reduce(reducer, 0); //=> 42
```

---

# Reduce Explained

The `reduce` algorithm can be difficult to follow at first; here's a walkthrough:

| Iteration | Accumulator In | Word | Length | Accumulator Out |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  0 | 'Alice'   | 5 | 0 + 5 = 5 |
| 2 |  5 | 'Bob'     | 3 | 5 + 3 = 8 |
| 3 |  8 | 'Charlie' | 7 | 8 + 7 = 15 |
| 4 | 15 | 'Carol'   | 5 | 15 + 5 = 20 |
| 5 | 20 | 'David'   | 5 | 20 + 5 = 25 |

The accumulator is used to pass information from one iteration to the next.

# Code Along: Enemies List Refactoring

Refactoring is changing existing code so that it *works* the same, but is cleaner and easier to read.

Let's go back to the old Hello Frenemy Input lab, and use arrays to make it a little bit cleaner!
